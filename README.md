# numbers

This code first defines a function called number_to_words(). This function takes a number as input and returns the number in words. The function uses a series of if-else statements to determine how to convert the number to words. For example, if the number is 0, the function returns the string "zero". If the number is 1, the function returns the string "one". And so on.

The code then prompts the user to enter a number between 0 and 100. The user's input is then stored in the variable number. The code then calls the number_to_words() function, passing in the value of number as an argument. The number_to_words() function then returns the number in words. The code then prints the result.

If the user enters a number that is not between 0 and 100, the code will print the message "Invalid number".
